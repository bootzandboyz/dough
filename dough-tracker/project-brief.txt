Project Name - Dough Counter 

OB Pizza does not currently have a streamlined system for cataloging and tracking inventory. 

Description - This is a tool designed for OB Pizza to calculate:
    1. the number of pizza doughs in our inventory
    2. the state of the pizza doughs 
        a. rolled doughs (ready to use)
        b. proofed doughs (ready to be rolled)
        c. pulled doughs (pulled from the freezer and thawing)
    3. a suggested number of cases of pizza dough to order


Goals - 
    1. Able to predict how many doughs to roll out on Saturday nights → prevent excess doughs from being rolled and not used. (OB Pizza is closed Monday and Sunday)
    2. Able to log food waste (spoilage or burnt food)
    3. Integrate ordering (automatic and/or an “add to order”)
    4. Able to suggest if & when all inventory items need to ordered/added to the weekly truck order based on historical orders and current stock 
    5. Help prevent running out of ingredients and reduce the likelihood of having to temporary remove menu items
    6.
